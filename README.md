- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KDen404
I am a 23 year old Game Engineering Bachelor of Science Student, I mainly solve problems in C++ and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, MySQL and learning this weird language used to create SourceMod Server Plugins.

I only got time to work on my projects in my spare time, which means if i don't upload for a long time this means i simply got no time to work on my projects...

Currently employed at: [ProjektAdler](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer)
